Problem Statement:
This final exam aimed to use EDA, Machine Learning Techniques, and PCA to develope a steamlit app based on a dataset given.
Input and Output Variables:
Inputs:
'Fixed Carbon', 'Ash', 'H', 'N', 'Temperature (c)', 
              'Biochar Yield (%)', 'Volatile Matter', 'C', 'O', 'N.1', 'Residence time (min)', 'Temperature (c).1',
              'Heating Rate (C/min)', 'Biochar Yield (%)',
              'Fixed Carbon.1', 'Volatile Matter.1', 'Ash.1', 'C.1', 'H.1', 'O.1', 'N.2'

Outputs:
Model Training and Evaluation: Trains various machine learning models, evaluates their performance using metrics like R-squared, MSE, and MAE, and selects the best-performing models.
Cross-Validation: Improves model reliability by assessing performance on multiple folds of the data.
Feature Preprocessing: Prepares data for modeling by handling numerical and categorical features (e.g., scaling, encoding).
Model Pipeline: Combines data preprocessing and model training into a single pipeline for efficient workflow.
Correlation Plot: Visualizes the relationships between features to identify potential correlations.
SHAP Explanations: Provides insights into the importance of features in making predictions, helping to understand the model's decision-making process.

Machine Learning Algorithm(s): 
SGD: Optimizes models iteratively using gradients.
Random Forest: Ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy.
Gradient Boosting: Sequentially builds models to correct errors.
AdaBoost: Combines weak learners to create a strong model.
Decision Tree: Tree-like model for classification and regression.
MLP: Neural network with multiple layers.
SVR: SVM-based regression algorithm.
XGBoost: Efficient gradient boosting implementation.
Linear Regression: Models linear relationship between variables.
Extra Trees: Random forest with more randomness in tree construction.
